# FACE_MASK_DETECTION
We have created a Realtime Face Mask Detection System using Deep Learing and OpenCV.
We have used the Dataset prepared by [Prajna Bhandary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prajna-bhandary-0b03a416a/) and available at [Github](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data)

And for the classification process we have used the Convolution Neural Networks.
